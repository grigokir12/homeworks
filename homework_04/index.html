			<p>
				Jerusalem has an ancient history, beginning over 5,000 years ago and serving as a significant religious
				and
				political
				center for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Conquered and reconquered numerous times, notable periods
				include King
				David's establishment of it as the Jewish capital and builder of the First Temple, the Roman destruction
				of
				the Second
				Temple in 70 AD, the Crusades that saw Christian control, and its later development under the Islamic
				Ottoman Empire.
				Its status continues to be a central issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflic

			<p>
				Jerusalem offers tourists historical, religious, and cultural attractions, with key sites including the
				Old
				City, home
				to the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Haram al-Sharif (Temple Mount); other
				popular
				attractions
				are the Israel Museum, Yad Vashem (The World Holocaust Remembrance Center), and the Tower of David.
				Visitors
				can explore
				different quarters, walk the city walls, follow the Via Dolorosa, and experience local life at the
				Mahane
				Yehuda Market.

			<h2 id="holy-city" class="article-c">Jerusalem as a holy city</h2>
			<p>
				Jerusalem is a holy city for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam because it houses sacred sites central to
				each
				faith's
				beliefs and practices. For Jews, it is home to the Western Wall, the last remnant of the Second Temple,
				and
				a historical
				center of worship. For Christians, it is the site of Jesus' Passion, death, and resurrection, with the
				Church of the
				Holy Sepulchre marking his tomb. For Muslims, the Dome of the Rock is on the Temple Mount, where they
				believe the
				Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven

				<h2 class="article-d_war">The War In Israel</h2>
				<p>
					The Gaza war is an armed conflict in the Gaza Strip and Israel, fought as part of the unresolved
					Israeli–Palestinian
					and Gaza–Israel conflicts dating back to the 20th century. The war began on 7 October 2023, when
					Hamas
					and other
					Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel, in which 1,195 Israelis and
					foreign
					nationals,
					including 815 civilians, were killed. 251 were taken hostage with the stated goal of forcing Israel
					to
					release
					Palestinian prisoners. Since the start of the Israeli offensive that followed, over 66,000
					Palestinians
					in Gaza have
					been killed, almost half of them women and children, and more than 168,000 injured. A
					study in The Lancet
					estimated that traumatic injury deaths were undercounted by June 2024, while noting a potentially
					even
					larger death toll
					when "indirect" deaths are included.
				</p>
				<p>
					The current war follows those of 2008–2009, 2012, 2014, and the 2021 clashes. After clearing
					militants
					from its
					territory, Israel launched a bombing campaign and invaded Gaza on 27 October with the stated
					objectives
					of destroying
					Hamas and freeing the hostages. Israeli forces launched numerous campaigns, including the Rafah
					offensive from May,
					three battles fought around Khan Yunis, and the siege of North Gaza from October, culminating in
					a 2025
					offensive in
					Gaza City; and have assassinated Hamas leaders inside and outside of Gaza. A temporary ceasefire
					in
					November 2023 broke
					down, and a second ceasefire in January 2025 ended with a surprise attack by Israel in March.
				</p>
				<p>
					The war has resulted in a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel's tightened blockade cut off basic
					necessities, causing a
					severe hunger crisis, malnutrition, and imminent to confirmed famine as of September
					2025.By early
					2025, Israel had caused unprecedented destruction in Gaza and made large parts of it
					uninhabitable,
					leveling entire
					cities and destroying hospitals (including children's hospitals), religious and cultural
					landmarks,
					educational facilities, agricultural land, and cemeteries. Gazan journalists,
					health
					workers, aid workers and other members of civil society have been detained, tortured and
					killed. Nearly all of
					the strip's 2.3 million Palestinian population have been forcibly displaced. Over 100,000
					Israelis were
					internally displaced at the height of the conflict. The first day was the deadliest in Israel's
					history, and the
					war is the deadliest for Palestinians in the broader conflict.
				</p>
				<p>
					Though initially disputed, a wide consensus of scholarship has concluded that Israel is
					committing
					genocide in
					Gaza. A case accusing Israel of genocide is being reviewed by the International
					Court of
					Justice. Experts and human rights organizations have also stated that Israel and Hamas have
					committed other war
					crimes. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav
					Gallant
					and Mohammed
					Deif, though Deif's was withdrawn after an Israeli airstrike killed him. Torture and
					sexual violence have
					been committed by Palestinian militant groups and by Israeli forces.
				</p>
				<img class="img-d" src="img/IsraWar.avif" alt="photo of soldiers in the car">
				<p>
					Israel has received extensive military and diplomatic support from the United States, which has
					vetoed
					multiple
					pro-ceasefire resolutions from the UN Security Council. The war has reverberated regionally, with
					Axis
					of
					Resistance groups across several Arab countries and Iran clashing with the United States and Israel,
					including the
					12-day Iran–Israel war. A year of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah led to the Israeli invasion
					of
					Lebanon, ongoing
					Israeli operations in Syria, as well as contributing to the fall of the Assad regime. The war
					continues to
					have
					significant regional and international repercussions, with large protests worldwide calling for a
					ceasefire,
					as well as
					a surge of antisemitism and anti-Palestinian racism.
